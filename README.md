# WeatherApp

Weather App was created with React Native using Geolocation on Maps, taking the instant location as latitude and longitude parameters and converting it to location using OpenWeatherMap API service.
At the same time, the instant weather conditions of different countries were displayed to the user as the page was refreshed with 'pull to refresh'.
The application background has been changed according to the weather in the user's location.
